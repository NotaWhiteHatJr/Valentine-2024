# Valentine-2024
A petite attempt on creating a subpar website that helps you ask your crush out in a quirky way.

Scared of making obvious moves on your crush? Wanna ask your techy partner out for a date? I've got you.
Here's an fun giddy way to ease up the barriers and tension to get your target to go out with you on a date.
Let's break down the steps:
1) Send this link to the target ðŸŽ¯: [Click me](file:///F:/Valentine/Asking-for-a-Date-from-your-Crush-main/Asking-for-a-Date-from-your-Crush-main/Date/Date.html)
2) The following page pops up first

3) Well, it's not them if they don't play hard to get, are they? Seems that they pressed the "nah, pass" button
